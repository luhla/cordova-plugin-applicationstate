### Description of States
#### iOS
- **active:** The app is running in the foreground and currently receiving events. (https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplicationstate/uiapplicationstateactive)
- **background:** The app is running in the background. (https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplicationstate/uiapplicationstatebackground)
- **inactive:** The app is running in the foreground but is not receiving events. This might happen as a result of an interruption or because the app is transitioning to or from the background. (https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplicationstate/uiapplicationstateinactive)

#### Android
(https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.RunningTaskInfo.html#topActivity)
- **active:** The app is the topmost activity
- **background:** The app is NOT the topmost activity
